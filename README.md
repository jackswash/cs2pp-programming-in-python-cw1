# CS2PP Programming in Python - Coursework 1

A comprehensive Python project with 3 main programming tasks plus reflection demonstrating the implementation of programming concepts. This coursework disallowed the use of any tools outside of the Python standard library. This was my python programming project in Year 2. 

**Grade for this assignment: 91.5% (First-Class honours)**

## Getting Started

### Quick Preview
- **View `CS2PP_CW1.html`** - HTML representation of notebook
- **Or `CS2PP_CW1.ipynb`** - Fully executed notebook with all outputs

### To Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed
3. Open `CS2PP_CW1.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab
4. All cells are pre-executed, but you can run the notebook step by step to see how it works

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- No external packages required (Python standard library only)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Graph theory and network analysis
- Data processing and CSV manipulation
- Algorithm optimisation and complexity analysis
- JSON configuration management
- Performance benchmarking

## Project Tasks

**Task 1: Structuring and Analysing Network Data**
- Implementation of edge lists and adjacency lists from dolphins.tsv dataset
- Dual implementations differing in algorithmic efficiency (O(n) vs O(n²))
- Analysis of bottlenose dolphin social network characteristics
- Performance comparison and optimisation techniques

**Task 2: Data Processing**
- Robust CSV manipulation and transformation pipelines using cardata.csv
- Data validation, cleaning, and preprocessing workflows
- File I/O operations with pure Python standard library
- Production of cardata_modified.csv for subsequent analysis

**Task 3: Python Classes**
- Tournament class design with full encapsulation and modularity
- JSON-driven configuration management system (config.json)
- Competition simulation with advanced scoring algorithms
- Tournament_optimised class implementation with performance enhancements

**Task 4: Reflecting on Your Work**
- Critical analysis of implementation challenges and solutions
- Justification of coding choices and methodological approaches
- Technical reflection on module content application

## Datasets Used
- **dolphins.tsv**: Social network of bottlenose dolphins showing frequent associations
- **cardata.csv**: Car characteristics from Edmunds and Twitter for price prediction modelling

## Tech stack
- **Python 3.11.7** - (Anaconda3 distribution 2024.02)
- **JupyterLab 4.0.11** - for interactive development
- **Python Standard Library Only** - No external packages permitted
- **JSON** - for configuration management
